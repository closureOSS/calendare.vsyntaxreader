# Library to parse and manipulate ICS files based on RFC5545

[![üè≠ Build](https://github.com/closureOSS/calendare.vsyntaxreader/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/closureOSS/calendare.vsyntaxreader/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

# Why

This C# library was specifically developed for reading and manipulating RFC5545 iCalendar (ICS) files, with a primary focus on **server-side applications**, such as calendar servers.  The goal was to create a robust and permissive library that can handle the many quirks and non-compliant behaviors of various calendar clients in the wild.

* Permissive Parsing: The library is built to be tolerant of malformed or non-standard ICS data, allowing it to successfully parse files from as many different clients as possible.

* Timezone Handling: Accurate handling of timezones is crucial for international scheduling. This library includes a dedicated and robust system for processing timezone definitions to ensure events are displayed correctly for users across the globe.

* Modern Feature Support: This includes support for the components VAvailability (RFC 7953), which is helpful for free/busy scheduling, and VPoll (RFC 9073), which enables calendar-based polling and voting features.

* This library is not intended for client-side use, such as creating new events or managing a user's local calendar.

## Testcases (ICS files)

The test ICS files, in the ./data/ subdirectories, are largely derived from [Ical.Net](https://github.com/ical-org/ical.net) version 4 (circa February 2023). Ical.Net's test cases were originally created for the [libical project](https://github.com/libical/libical).

Some test ICS files where originally created for [DAViCal](https://gitlab.com/davical-project/davical).

These files may have been altered after they were copied from Ical.Net or DAViCal.
